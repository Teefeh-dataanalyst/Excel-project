## Methodology
Excel : Used for data cleaning,table merging,pivot tables creation for analysis and dashboard creation for intuisive analysis and visualization.
Removal of dublicates was done as the rough data has quite a number of duplicates
The data was subjected to pivot analysis to get the primary KPI's which include total number of casualties, Sum of casualties in respect to accident severity
the following secondary KPI's were as well analysed:casualties in respect to vehicle type, casualties in respect to road type, Casualties in respect to road surface as well as casualties in respect to urban or rural area
The project was further displayed on a dashboard for better visualization.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed that:
- The majority of casualties in respect to vehicle type occur with car(300,000 plus casualties)
- Urban area also has the highest number of casualties compared to the rural area which can be attributed to road surface
- Most accident also occur during the day time.
